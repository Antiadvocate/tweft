/**
 * Pressure controller — replaces the Threat Director LLM call. Zero tokens.
 *
 * Model: scene pressure P_t ∈ [0,10] drawn from a difficulty-defined target
 * mixture, corrected by a proportional controller on the rolling empirical
 * mean (so long-run distribution converges to target — verified by Monte
 * Carlo in verify/verify.ts), with hard constraints:
 *   C1 opening grace:        t ≤ 2 ⇒ P ≤ 2
 *   C2 breath rule:          mean(P_{t-2}, P_{t-1}) ≥ 7 ⇒ P ≤ 4
 *   C3 lethality ceiling:    lethality=low ⇒ P ≤ 9; medium ⇒ ≤ 10 with cause
 *   C4 earned danger:        P ≥ 8 requires max(thread tension, clock heat) ≥ 6
 *   C5 mundane default:      restful intents bias the draw down 2 bands
 *
 * The fiction-awareness the old LLM director provided is recovered from
 * state: thread tension (set by the Simulator), due consequences, and
 * faction clock heat feed an additive "fiction heat" term — so pressure is
 * still earned by the story, just computed instead of asked for.
