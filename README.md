# Weft — a world that reacts (GitHub Pages build)

A persistent, social world-simulation engine with an LLM narrator. **This build runs entirely in your browser** — no server, no backend. The engine, the saves, and everything else live on your device; it talks to language models through *your own* OpenRouter key.

## Deploy it to your repo (the easy way)

1. Create a new GitHub repository and upload these files (or push this folder to it).
2. In the repo, go to **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source → GitHub Actions**.
3. Push to `main`. The included workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) builds and publishes automatically.
4. Open the URL Pages gives you (e.g. `https://yourname.github.io/weft/`). Paste your OpenRouter key when prompted. Play.

That's it. Every push rebuilds and redeploys.

### Run it locally first (optional)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173
npm run build    # produces dist/ — the exact static bundle Pages serves
npm run preview  # serve the built dist/ locally
```

## The OpenRouter key

Weft has no server to hold a secret, so it uses **your** key, entered once and stored in your browser's `localStorage` on that device only. It is sent directly to OpenRouter and to nowhere else. Get one (free and paid models available) at <https://openrouter.ai/keys>. You can change it anytime in **Tuning**.

Because the key lives in the browser, **don't** hard-code it into the source or commit it. Anyone who can use your deployed page uses their own key.

> Note: calls go from your browser straight to `openrouter.ai`, which permits cross-origin requests. If your network or an extension blocks third-party requests, the model calls won't go through.

## Where your data lives

Saves (including any AI-generated portraits and scene art) are stored in your browser via **IndexedDB**. They persist across reloads but are tied to that browser/profile. Use **Tuning → Export save** to download a `.weft.json` you can back up or move; **Library → Import** to load one anywhere.

## What's inside

The full engine ported to the browser:

- **Two-call turn loop** — a streamed narrator and a single strict-JSON simulator; everything else is deterministic and free.
- **The Undertow** — the continuous substrate: logit Quantal Response Equilibrium stances, a frustrated Kuramoto network with a Benettin Lyapunov estimate of the world's regime, cusp-catastrophe psyches that home to each person's set point, and Scheffer early-warning signals.
- **Time-and-place-stamped memory** — every memory records *when* (in-world time) and *where* it happened, and the narrator sees lived distance ("Day 5, ≈3 weeks ago, at the Loom") so old events read as old, not as fresh shocks. Moving somewhere auto-writes a "left X for Y" memory, so a companion of a thousand turns actually remembers where she's been.
- **Identity that earns its changes** — acquired traits and beliefs are now visible in the Cast drawer (with intensity/integration), and a full **raw JSON editor** is back — for characters (identity, condition, traits, memory) AND for the **world** (Tuning → Raw world edit: bible, threads, faction clocks, places, edges, canon), so you can fix anything the forge over-baked right at turn 1 (per-character: identity, condition, traits, memory — add traits/beliefs by hand). Speech is **derived live** every turn from baseline + strong acquired traits + age + current mood + the relationship to whoever's being addressed (a character is cutting to a hostile cop, soft to a lover). And deeply-held acquired traits **consolidate**: reinforced across a long arc, they fold permanently into core traits and the spoken voice — earned slowly, never from a single scene.
- **Grounded complications** — a higher pressure reading no longer licenses invented lore. Complications must grow from what's already established (a thread, a known player, the scene), proportionate to what's happening; the engine will never spring a world-altering revelation, secret identity, or "you were a different species all along" retcon to fill a pressure quota. If there's no grounded friction, a quiet beat is correct. And in focus mode the controller can no longer push pressure UP to hit its target at all — a quiet stretch stays quiet.
- **Focus phases (converge, then escalate)** — focus on an event and the story *builds* toward it: new unrelated chaos is suppressed and every scene bends toward the throughline, while the controller is forbidden from manufacturing friction to hit a quota. When the event actually fires on the clock, the phase **auto-advances** — "prepare for war" flips to "fighting the war," and the tension default flips from suppressed to hot, on its own. Fully generic; driven by the scheduled event firing, not by any keywords. Tap the X to release. 
- **Set the clock by hand** — when the bookkeeper's time drifts from the prose (it says morning, the clock says 18:00), fix it from the Play screen's time control or in Raw world edit. 
- **Events fire on the clock, not the turn counter** — when the fiction says something happens "in two days" or "at dawn", it's now scheduled against in-world time and held there. It won't spring in minutes just because several fast conversational turns passed; it comes due only when the calendar actually reaches it (including across time-skips), then arrives on its own.
- **Story beats, not a talking simulator** — the narrator is now required to MOVE the situation every turn (an action, a discovery, an arrival, a position won or lost), action is fast and physical (no lengthy dialogue mid-fight), and low pressure means "no threat" rather than "nothing happens." Crucially, conflict no longer converges on everyone turning out good: hostility, contempt, and irreconcilable difference are valid lasting endpoints, and a character softening is a rare earned event, not a scene's default arc.
- **Your direction is law** — your standing direction now sits at the TOP of the prompt as a supreme override, above the world bible, the cast, the clocks, and the model's own sense of drama. If you say a power/trait/topic is incidental and NOT the story, the narrator and simulator are bound to keep it peripheral every turn and never spin faction objectives or threads around it. The model subverting your stated premise to chase "interesting tension" is now defined as its worst possible failure.
- **Token usage is visible** — the Chronicle shows a running token breakdown (input/output/total, per-turn average, and which model is your narrator and what share of spend it is), and flags when the narrator is a premium model so a $50 surprise can't sneak up on you. (Weft sees token counts, not prices — check openrouter.ai/activity for live billing.)
- **Neutral is the default** — characters no longer manufacture suspicion or menace from ordinary input. The clench/paranoia physics applies only to characters whose state is actually clenched or whose traits are genuinely hostile; a calm, intact character reads situations accurately and reacts like a normal adult (curious, mildly skeptical, busy). A nervous newcomer asking for help gets a conversation, not a containment protocol. Escalation must be earned by events, not generated from vibes — and the narrator won't invent threatening backstory the state doesn't contain.
- **Lucid villains** — the clench/openness physics governs the *wounded*; it no longer forces antagonists to be secretly good. Characters marked dark (manipulative, ruthless, predatory) are written as clearly, comfortably cruel.
- **A real location model** — every character (you included) has a *place*, tracked by the bookkeeper from the prose: walk somewhere and your location follows; teleport or summon someone and the engine actually moves them there; name a far-off character and they're referenced, not teleported. Places (including in-between ones like "walking outside the dome") are auto-created on first mention. Who's "in the scene" is *derived* from co-location — never authored — so people stop materialising across the world mid-sentence.
- **Editable opening** — generate, hand-edit, or clear the scene you start in (Tuning → Opening scene), shown as "the beginning" before turn 1.
- **New chapter (RECAP)** — the Sprout button on any save distills its whole world-state into a fresh game after a time skip: surviving cast carried forward with evolved traits and relationships baked in, canon preserved, opening narrated as "RECAP: …". A season-2 generator.
- **Character texture** — every character carries a few small standing interests, quirks, and sensitivities (generated from their background at forge, and the engine can quietly grow one when the story earns it — someone who keeps fishing "has taken to fishing"). The narrator surfaces these lightly in quiet moments — a tree-lover pausing at a good one — as seasoning, never the meal, never during tense scenes. Paired with a familiarity rule so long-established situations read as worn-in routine instead of perpetual revelation (no more "we're really doing this" about a six-month marriage).
- **The web — a relationship graph** in the World tab: the whole cast as a diagram, player at center, edges colored by warmth (green warm / amber cool / red hostile) and weighted by strength. Tap any face to isolate their ties. Makes the social simulation legible at a glance — and surfaces an all-allies or all-hostile cast instantly.
- **Who's here** — the Play screen now shows a strip of exactly which characters are in the scene with you (with their faces) and where, so no one is silently present.
- **Characters actually grow** — acquired traits now fire on any meaningful beat (a betrayal, a kindness, a humiliation, a faced fear), planted at low intensity and strengthening with repetition, visible in the Cast drawer's "becoming" section.
- **The dead leave the stage** — when a character is killed or permanently leaves the story, the Simulator records it; they're pulled from the scene and every room, stop getting new drives, vanish from the relationship web, and move to a collapsed "Gone" section in the cast (greyed, with how they exited) — instead of lingering as an active being. (You can revive or remove anyone by hand in the raw character editor by setting their status.)
- **Multiple drives per character** — each tracked character can hold a priority stack of up to three goals. They pursue the top one, but when it stalls, completes, or the scene goes quiet, they switch to a higher- or equal-priority backup — leaving a calm thread to chase a more pressing one elsewhere instead of hovering near you.
- **NPC autonomy & tracking** — named characters you engage join the "long game": offscreen they keep wanting things. When a character finishes a drive (or has none), the engine seeds a new one from *who they are* — their traits, values, and how they feel about everyone else — so a detective starts a new case, a thief plans a score, a rival regroups, all without you authoring it. Follow/unfollow any character with the eye toggle in **Cast**; the narrator can also pull a character into the long game when a thread makes them matter. Unfollowed bit-players recede into the background.
- **Continuity** — let the world turn (deterministic multi-day skips with an interlude), and vessels (leave your character, become another, full identity swap).
- **Canon** — world-altering public events every mind remembers forever.
- **Park-style memory** with reflection, a social fabric of edges + rumor cascades, faction clocks, deterministic pressure control, the full world-bible & character editors, God Mode, dark/light, image generation, and the Chronicle's arcs, records, and regime read-outs.

**Art direction you control** (Tuning → Art direction): set the visual style once — "muted painterly chiaroscuro", "90s cel anime", "gritty photoreal" — and it governs all images. Portraits are full-body, head-to-toe, on a white studio background, and the prompt reads the *whole* character (appearance, core + acquired traits, current bearing, even a guiding belief) so the figure looks like who they actually are. Those portraits are then fed as reference images when illustrating a scene, so the cast stays visually consistent (on image models that accept multimodal input, e.g. the Gemini flash-image family).

You can choose any OpenRouter image model for portraits and scene art in **Tuning → Images** (Gemini, FLUX, GPT-Image, etc.), and tap any portrait or scene illustration to view it full-screen.

Built with React 19 + Vite + Tailwind 4 + Motion. `base: "./"` means it works from a user root *or* a project subpath with no per-repo configuration.
